User Management REST API:
Welcome to the User Management REST API repository! This project provides a RESTful API for managing users, where a single user can have multiple users associated with it. 
The API is implemented using Spring Boot and MySQL, and it includes GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE methods for managing user data. Additionally, the API integrates Spring Security 
to ensure that users are authenticated with a username and password before accessing details.
